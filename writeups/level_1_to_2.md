# Natas Level 1 -> Level 2

Unlike prior levels the solution isn't directly in the HTML. Rather in the html there's an image tag with source **files/pixel.png**.
Navigating to [natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/](http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/) path we find other files that are present in the server. One of them is a **users.txt** file. Which contains usernames and their corresponding passwords. Natas3 password can be found there.
