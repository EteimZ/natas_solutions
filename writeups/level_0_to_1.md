# Natas Level 0 -> Level 1

In this level right clicking is disabled in the browser. One solution would be to disable JavaScript in you browser.
Another is to use a different HTTP client to get the page source code directly. I used curl:

```bash
curl -u natas1:<natas1_password> http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org
```
